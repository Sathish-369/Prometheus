How to carry out the work
1. Open Slave node and navigate to the /opt folder.

2. Visit the following website(https://prometheus.io/download/) to get the most recent version of node_exporter, then write the commend as follows
wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.6.0/node_exporter-1.6.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz


3. But keep in mind that on Slave, you must either customize your port or enable all TCP ports 0 to 65535.
	In AWS enable all tcp on security group.

4. After you've done the wget command, node_exporter will install on your slave machine, to proceed further please unzip it.

tar -xzvf "file name" 

5. Once it has been unzipped, run the commend bellow. 

./node_exporter

6. Then, to test node_exporter UI in your browser. 

hostname or ip :9100

7. Now exit the node_exporter and execute follwoing steps.

  
8. Now we copy the node_exporter from the opt to the bin folder.
cp -r ./usr/local/bin/node_exporter

9. Now configure node_exporter as a background service since if you leave it above, you won't be able to perform any other tasks on that node because as you exit node_exporter, it will stop functioning. 

vi /etc/systemd/system/promethus.service
